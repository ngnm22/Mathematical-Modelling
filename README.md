# Modelling a way of cleaning space debris
Whether it is natural or man-made, there has been a large increase of space debris over the years, that presents a detrimental threat to current satellites in space if collisions occur. The aim of this report is to find a method for cleaning this debris to prevent this from happening. To do this, we first investigate the impact of space debris and how long it takes to fall back to Earth by how it behaves in the atmosphere. We then look at a method of cleaning debris that manoeuvres a spacecraft using force thrusters to capture the debris. We model this by using Newtonian Mechanics to calculate the best distance, time and the minimum fuel used, which will help us find the best strategy for cleaning debris.
